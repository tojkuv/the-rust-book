## Traits: Defining Shared Behavior

a *trait* defines functionality a particular type has and can share with other types. We can use traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way. We can use *trait bounds* to specify that a generic type can be any type that has certain behavior.

### Defining a Trait

A type's behavior consists of the methods we can call on that type. Different types share the same behavior if we can call the same methods on all of those types. Trait definitions are a way to group method signatures together to define a set of behavioors necessary to accomplish some purpose.

For example, let's say we have multiple structs that hold various kinds and amounts of text: a `NewsArticle` struct that holds a news story filed in a particular location and a `Tweet` that can have at most 280 characters along with metadata that indicates whether it was a new tweet, a retweet, or a reply to another tweet.

We want to make a media aggregator library crate named `aggregator` that can display summaries of data that might be stored in a `NewsArticle` or `Tweet` instance. To do this, we need a summary from each type, and we'll request that summary by calling a `summarize` method on an instance. Listing 10-12 shows the definition of a public `Summary` trait that expresses this behavior.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(self: &Self) -> String;
}
```

Listing 10-12: A `Summary` trait that consists of the behavior provided by a `summarize` method

Here, we declare a trait using the `trait` keyword and then the trait's name, which is `Summary` in this case. We've  also declared the trait as `pub` so that crates depending on this crate can make use of this trait too, as we'll see in a few examples. Inside the braces, we declare the method sugnatures that descrube theh behaviors of the types that implement this trait, which in this case is `fn summarize(self: &Self) -> String;`

After the method signature, instead of providing an implementation within braces, we use a semicolon. Each type implementing this trait must provide its own custom behavior for the body of the method. The compiler will enforce that any type that has the `Summary` trait will have the method `summarize` defined with this exactly.

A trait can have multiple methods in its body: the method signatures are listed one per line and each line ends in a semicolon.

### Implementing a Trait on a Type

Now that we've defined the desired signatures of the `Summary` trait's methods, we can implement it on the types in our media aggregator. Listing 10-13 shows an implementation of the `Summary` trait on the `NewsArticle` struct that uses the headline, the author, and the location to create the return value of `summarize`. For the `Tweet` struct, we define `summarize` as the username followed by the entire text of the tweet, assuming that tweet content is already limited to 280 characters.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
pub struct NewsArticle {
    pub headline: String,
    pub location: String,
    pub author: String,
    pub content: String,
}

impl Summary for NewsArticle {
    fn summarize(self: &Self) -> String {
        format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)    
    }
}

pub struct Tweet {
    pub username: String,
    pub content: String,
    pub reply: bool,
    pub retweet: bool,
}

impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize(self: &Self) -> String {
        format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
    }
}
```

Listing 10-13 Implementing the `Summary` trait on the `NewsArticle` and `Tweet` types

Implementing a trait on a type is similar to implemeting regular methods. The difference is that after `impl`, we put the trait name we want to implement, then use the `for` keyword, and then specify the name of the type we want to implement the trait for. Within the `impl` block, we put the method signatures that the trait definition has defined. Instead of adding a semicolon after each signature, we use curly brackets and fill in the method body with the specific behavior that we want the methods of the trait to have for the particular type.

Now that the library has implemented the `Summary` trait on `NewsArticle` and `Tweet`, users of the crate can call the trait methods on instances of `NewsArticle` and `Tweet` in the same way we call regular methods. The only difference is that the user must bring the trait into scope as well as the types. Here's an example of how a binary crate could use our `aggregator` library crate:

```rust
use aggregator:::{Summary, Tweet};

fn main() {
    let tweet = Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from("of course, as you probably already know, people"),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    };

    println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());
}
```

This code prints `1 new tweet: horse_ebooks: of course, as you probably already know, people.`

Other crates that depend on the `aggregator` crate can also bring the `Summary` trait into scope to implement `Summary` on their own types. One restriction to note is that we can implement a trait on a type only if at least one of the trait or the type is local to our crate. Foor example, we can implement standard library traits like `Display` onn a custom type like `Tweet` as part of our `aggregaor` crate functionality, because the type `Tweet` is local to our `aggregator` crate. We can also implement `Summary` on `Vec<T>` in our `aggregator` crate, because the trait `Summary` is local to our `aggregator` crate.

But we can'_t implement external traits on external types. For example, we can'_t implement the `Display` trait on `Vec<T>` within our `aggregator` crate, because `Display` and `Vec<T>` are both defined in the standard library and aren'_t local to our `aggregator` crate. This restriction is part of a property called *coherence*, and more specifically the *orphan rule*, so named because the parent type is not present. This rule ensures that other people's code can'_t break your code and vice versa. Without the rule, two crates could implement the same trait for the same type, and Rust wouldn'_t know which implementation to use.

### Default Implementations

Sometimes it's useful to have default behavior for some or all of the methods in a trait instead of requiring implementations for all methods on every type. Then, as we implement the trait on a particular type, we can keep or override each method's default behavior.

In Listing 10-14 we specify a default string for the `summarize` method of the `Summary` trait instead of only defining the method signature, as we did in Listing 10-12.

```rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize(self: &Self) {
        String::from("(Read more...)")
    }
}
```

Listing 10-14: Defining a `Summary` trait with a default implementation of the `summarize` method

Even though we're no longer defining the `summarize` method on `NewsArticle` directly, we've provided a default implementation and specified that `NewsArticle` implements the `Summary` trait. As a result, we can still call the `summarize` method on an instance of `NewsArticle`, like this:

```rust
let article = NewsArticle {
    headline: String::from("Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!"),
    location: String::from("Pittsburgh, PA, USA"),
    author: String::from("Iceburgh"),
    content: String::from("The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best \             hockey team in the NHL.",),
};

println!("New article available! {}", article.sumamrize());
```

This code prints `New article available! (Read more...)`

Creating a default implementation doesn'_t require us to change anything about the implementation of `Summary` on `Tweet` in Listing 10-13. The reason is that the syntax for overriding a default implementation is the same as the syntax for implementing a trait method that doesn'_t have a default implementation.

Default implementation can call other methods in the same trait, even if those other methods don'_t have a default implementation. In this way, a trait can provide a lot of useful functionality and only require implementors to specify a small part of it. For example, we could define the `Summary` trait to have a `summarize_author` method whose implementation is required, and then define a `summarize` method that has a default implementation that calls the `summarize_author` method:

```rust
pub trait Summary {
    fn summarize_author(self: &Self) -> String;

    fn summarize(self: &Self) -> String {
        format!("(Read more from {}...)", self.username)
    }
}
```

To use this version of `Summary`, we only need to define `summarize_author` when we implement the trait on a type:

```rust
impl Summary for Tweet {
    fn summarize_author(self: &Self) -> String {
        format!("@{}", self.username)
    }
}
```

After we define `summarize_author`, we can call `summarize` on instances of the `Tweet` struct, and the default implementation of `summarize` will call the definition of `summarize_author` that we've provided. Because we've implemented `summarize_author`, the `Summary` trait has given us the behavior of the `summarize` method without requiring us to write any more code.

```rust
let tweet = Tweet {
    username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
    content: String::from("of course, as you probably already know, people"),
    reply: bool,
    retweet: bool,
};

println!("1 new tweet: {}", tweet.summarize());
```

This code prints `1 new tweet: (Read more from @horse_ebooks...)`.

Note that it isn'_t possible to call the default implementation from an overriding implementation of the same method.

### Traits as Parameters

Now that you know how to define and implement traits, we can explore how to use traits to define functions that accept many different types. We'll use the `Summary` trait we implemented on the `NewsArticle` and `Tweet` types in Listing 10-13 to define a `notify` function that calls the `summarize` method on its `item` parameter, which is of some type that implements the `Summary` trait. To do this, we use the `impl Trait` syntax, like this:

```rust
pub fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```

Instead of a concrete type for the `item` parameter, we specify the `impl` keyword and the trait name. This parameter accepts any type that implements the specified trait. In the body of `notify`, we can call any  methods on `item` that come from a `Summary` trait, such as `summarzie`. We can call `notify` and pass in any instance of `NewsArticle` or `Tweet`. Code that calls the function with any other type, such as a `String` or any `i32`, won'_t compile because those types don'_t implement `Summary`.

### Trait Bound Syntax

The `impl Trait` syntax works for straightforward cases but is actually syntax sugar for a longer form known as a *trait bound*; it looks like this:

```rust
pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {
    println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
}
```

This longer form is equivalent to the example in the previous section byt is more verbose. We place trait bounds with the declaration of the generic type parameter after a colon and inside chevrons.

The `imp Trait` syntax is convenient and makes for more concise code in simple cases, while the fuller trait bound syntax can express more complexity in other cases. For example, we can have two parameters that implement `Summary`. Doing so with the `impl Trait` syntax looks like this:

```rust
pub fn notify(item1: &impl Summary, item2: &impl Summary) {}
```

Using `impl Trait` is appropriate if we want this function to allow `item1` and `item2` to have different types (as log as both types implement `Summary`). If we want to force both parameters to have the same type, however, we must use the trait bound, like this:

```rust
pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item1: &T, item2: &T) {}
```

The generic type `T` specified as the type of the `item1` and `item2` parameters contains the function such that the concrete type of the value passed as an argument for `item1` and `item2` must be the same.

### Specifying Multiple Trait Bounds with the `+` Syntax

We can also specify more than one trait bound. Say we wanted `notify` to use display formatting as well as `summarize` on `item:` we specify in the `notify` definition that `item` must implement both `Display` and `Summary`. We can do so using the `+` syntax:

```rust
pub fn notify(item: &(impl Summary + Display)) {}
```

The `+` syntax is also valid with trait bounds on generic types:

```rust
pub fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {}
```

With the two trait bounds specified, the body of `notify` can call `summarize` and use `{}` to format `item`.

### Clearer Trait Bounds with `where` Clauses

Using too many trait bounds has its downsides. Each generic has its own trait bounds, so functions with multiple generic type parameters can contain lots of trait bound information between the function's name and its parameter list, making the function signature hard to read. for this reason, Rust has alternative syntax for specifying trait bounds inside a `where` clause after the function signature. So instead of writing this:

```rust
fn some_function<T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug>(_t: &T, u:  &U) -> i32 {}
```

we can use a `where` clause, like this:

```rust
fn some_function<T, U>(_t: &T, u: &U) -> i32 {
    where T: Display + Clone,
          U: Clone + Debug 
}
```

This function's signature is less cluttered: the function name, parameter list, and return type are close together, similar to a function without lots of trait bounds.

### Returning Types that Implement Traits

We can also use the `impl Trait` syntax in the return position to return a value of some type that implements a trait, as shown here:

```rust
fn returns_summarizable() -> impl Summary {
    Tweet {
        username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
        content: String::from(
            "of course, as you probably already know, people",
        ),
        reply: false,
        retweet: false,
    }
}
```

By using `impl Summary` for the return type, we specify that the `returns_summarizable` function returns some type that implements the `Summary` trait without naming the concrete type. In this case, `returns_summarizable` returns a `Tweet`, but the code calling this function doesn'_t need to know that.

The ability to specify a return type only by the trait it implements is especially useful in the context of closures and iterators, which we cover in Chapter 13. Closures and iterators create types that only the compiler knows or types that are very long to  specify. The `impl Trait` syntax lets you concisely specify that a function returns some type that implements the `Iterator` trait without needing to write out a very long type.

However, you can only use `impl Trait` if you're returining a single type. For example, this code that returns either a `NewsArticle` or a `Tweet` with the return specified as `impl Summary` wouldn'_t work:

```rust
fn returns_summarizable(switch: bool) -> impl Summary {
    if switch {
        NewsArticle {
            headline: String::from(
                "Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!",
            ),
            location: String::from("Pittsburgh, PA, USA"),
            author: String::from("Iceburgh"),
            content: String::from(
                "The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best \
                 hockey team in the NHL.",
            ),  
        }    
    } else {
        Tweet {
            username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
            content: String::from(
                "of course, as you probably already know, people",
            ),
            reply: false,
            retweet: false,
    }
}
```

Returning either a `NewsArticle` or a `Tweet` isn'_t allowed due to restrictions around how the `impl Trait` syntax is implemented in the compiler. We'll cover how to write a function with this behavior in the "Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types" section of Chapter 17.

### Fixing the `largest` Function with Trait Bounds

Now that you know how to specify the behavior you want using the generic type parameter's bounds, let's return to Listing 10-5 to fix the definition of the `largest` function that uses a generic type parameter! Last time we tried to run that code, we received this error:

```rust
$ cargo run
   Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects/chapter10)
error[E0369]: binary operation `>` cannot be applied to type `T`

  |

  |
help: consider restricting type parameter `T`
  |

  |             ++++++++++++++++++++++

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0369`.
error: could not compile `chapter10` due to previous error
```

In the body of `largest` we wanted to compare two values of type `T` using the greater than (`>`) operator. Because that operator is defined as a default method on the standard library trait `std::cmp::PartialOrd`, we need to specify `PartialOrd` in the trait bounds for `T` so the `largest` function can work on slices of any type that we can compare. We don'_t need to bring `PartialOrd` into scope because it's in the prelude. Change the signature of `largest` to look like this:

```rust
fn largest<T: PartialOrd>(list: &[T]) -> T {}
```

This time when we compile the code, we get a different set of errors:

```rust
$ cargo run
   Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects/chapter10)

error: could not compile `chapter10` due to 2 previous errors
```

The key line in this error is `cannot move out of type [T], a non-copy slice`. With  our non-generic versions of the `largest` function, we were only  tying to find the largest `i32` or `char`. As discussed in the "Stack-Only Data: Copy" section in Chapter 4, types like `i32` and `char` that have a known size can be stored on the stack, so they implement the `Copy` trait. But when we made the `largest` function generic, it became possible for the `list` parameter to have types in it that don'_t implement the `Copy` trait. Consequently, we wouldn'_t be able to move the function implement the `ParticalOrd` *and* `Copy` traits, like `i32` and `char` do.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn largest<T: ParticalOrd + Copy>(list: &[T]) -> T {
    let mut largest = list[0];

    for item in list {
        if item > largest {
            largest = item; // copy not move so its ok
        }
    }

    largest
}

fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let result = largest(&number_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}}", result);

    let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];

    let result = largest(&char_list);
    println!("The largest number is {}", result);
}
```

Listing 10-15: A working definition of the `largest` function that works on any generic type that implements the `PartialOrd` and `Copy` traits

If we don'_t want to restrict the `largest` function to the types that implement the `Copy` trait, we could specify that `T` has the trait bound `Clone` instead of `Copy`. Then we could clone each value in the slice when we want to `largest` function to have ownership. Using the `clone` function means we're potentially making more heap allocations in the case of types that own heap data like `String`, and heap allocations can be slow if we're working with large amounts of data.

We could also implement `largest` by having the function return a reference to a `T` value in the slice. If we change the return type to `&T` instead of `T`, thereby changing the body of the function to return a reference, we wouldn'_t need the `Clone` or `Copy` trait bounds and w could avoid heap allocations. Try implementing these alternate solutions on your own! If you get stuck with errors having to do with lifetimes, keep reading: the "Validating References with Lifetimes" section coming up will explain, but lifetimes aren'_t require to solve these challanges.

### Using Trait Bounds to Conditionally Implement Methods

By using a trait bound with an `impl` block that uses generic type parameters, we can implement methods conditionally for types that implement the specified traits. For example, the type `Pair<T>` in Listing 10-16 always implements the `new` function to return a new instance of `Pair<T>` (recall from the "Defining Methods" section of Chapter 5 that `Self` is a type alias for the type of the `impl` block, which in this case is `Pair<T>`). But in the next `impl` block, `Pair<T>` only implements the `cmp_display` method if tis inner type `T` implements the `PartialOrd` trait that enables comparisons *and* the `Display` trait that enables printing.

Filename: src/lib.rs

```rust
use std::fmt::Display;

struct Pair<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Pair<T> {
    fn new(x: T, y: T) -> Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }   
}

impl<T: Display + PartialOrd> Pair<T> {
    fn cmp_display(self: &Self) {
        if self.x >= self.y {
            println!("The largest member is x = {}", self.x);
        } else {
            println!("The largest member is y = {}", self.y);
        }
    }
}
```

Listing 10-16: Conditionally implement methods on a generic type depending on trait bounds

We can also conditionally implement a trait for any type that implements another trait. Implementations of a trait on any type that satisfies the trait bounds are called *blanket implementations* and are extensively used in the Rust standard library. For example, the standard library  implements the `ToString` trait on any type that implements the `Display` trait. The `impl` block in the standard library looks similar to this code:

```rust
impl<T: Display> ToString for T {
    // --snip--
}
```

Because the standard library has this blanket implementation, we can call the `to_string` method defined by the `ToString` trait on any type that implements the `Display` trait. For example, we can turn integers into their corresponding `String` values like this because integers implement `Display`:

```rust
let s = 3.to_string();
```

Blanket implementations appear in the documentation for the trait in the "Implementors" section.

Trait and trait bounds let us write code that uses generic type parameters to reduce duplication but also specify to the compiler that we want the generic type to have particular behavior. The compiler can then use the trait bound information to check that all the concrete types used with our code provide the correct behavior.

## Validating References with Lifetimes

Lifetimes are another kind of generic that we've already been using. Rather than ensuring that a type has the behavior we want, lifetimes ensure that references are valid as long as we need them to be.

One detail we didn'_t discuss in the "References and Borrowing" section in Chapter 4 is that every reference in Rust has a *lifetime*, which is the scope for which that reference is valid. Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and inferred, just like most of the time, types are inferred. We only must annotate types when multiple types are possible. In a similar way, we must annotate lifetimes when the lifetimes of references could be related in a few different ways. Rust requires us to annotate the relationships using generic lifetime parameters to ensure the actual references used at runtime will definitely be valid.

Annotating lifetimes is not even a concept most other programming languages have, so this is going to fee unfamiliar. Although we won'_t cover lifetimes in their entirety in this chapter, we'll discuss common ways you might encounter lifetime syntax so you can get comfortable with the concept.

### Preventing Dangling References with Lifetimes

The main aim of lifetimes is to prevent *dangling references*, which cause a program to reference data other than the ddata it's intended to reference. Consider the program in Listing 10-17, which has an outer scope and an innner scop.

```rust
{
    let r;

    {
        let x = 5;
        r = &x;
    }

    println!("r: {}", r));
}
```

Listing 10-17: An attempt to use a reference whose value has gone out of scope

```
Note: The examples in Listing 10-17, 10-18, and 10-24 declare variables
without giving them an initial value, so the variable name exists in the 
outer scope. At first glance, this might appear to be in conflict with
Rust's having no null valies.
However, if we try to use a variable before giving it a value, we'll get
a compile-time error, which shows that Rust indeed does not allow null
values.
```

The outer scope declares a variable named `r` with no initial value, and the inner scope declares a variable named `x` with the initial value of 5. Inside the inner scope, we attempt to set the value of `r` as a reference to `x`. Then the inner scope ends, and we attempt to print the value in `r`. This code won'_t compile because the value `r` is referring to has gone out of scope before we try to use it. Here is the error message:

```rust
$ cargo run
   Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects/chapter10)
error[E0597]: `x` does not live long enough
  --> src/main.rs:7:17
   |
7  |             r = &x;
   |                 ^^ borrowed value does not live long enough
8  |         }
   |         - `x` dropped here while still borrowed
9  | 
10 |         println!("r: {}", r);
   |                           - borrow later used here

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0597`.
error: could not compile `chapter10` due to previous error
```

The variable `x` doesn'_t "live long enough." The reason is that `x` will be out of scope when the inner scope ends on line 7. But `r` is still valid for the outer scope; because its scope is larger, we say that it "lives longer." If Rust allowed this code to work, `r` wwould be referincing memory that was deallocated when `x` went out of scope, and anything we tried to do with `r` wouldn'_t work correctly. So how does Rust determine that this code is invalid? It uses a vorrow checker.

### The Borrow Checker

The Rust compiler has a *borrow checker* that compares scopes to determine whether all borrows are valid. Listing 10=18 shows the same code as Listing 10=17 but with annotations showing the lifetimes of the variables.

```rust
fn main() {
    {
        let r;                // ---------+-- 'a
                              //          |
        {                     //          |
            let x = 5;        // -+-- 'b  |
            r = &x;           //  |       |
        }                     // -+       |
                              //          |
        println!("r: {}", r); //          |
    }                         // ---------+
}
```

Listing 10-18: Annotations of the lifetimes of `r` and `x`, named `'a` and `'b`. As you can see, the inner `'b` block is much smaller than the outer `'a` lifetime block. At compile time, Rust compares the size of the two lifetimes and sees that `r` has a lifetime of `'a` but that it refers to memory with a lifetime of `'b`. The program is rejected because `'b` is shorter than `'a`: the subject of the reference doesn'_t live as long as the reference.

Listing 10-19 fixes the code so it doesn'_t have a dangling reference and compiles without any errors.

```rust
fn main() {
    {
        let x = 5;            // ----------+-- 'b
                              //           |
        let r = &x;           // --+-- 'a  |
                              //   |       |
        println!("r: {}", r); //   |       |
                              // --+       |
    }                         // ----------+
}
```

Listing 10-19: A valid reference because the data has a longer lifetime than the reference

Here, `x` has the lifetime `'b`, which in this case is larger than `'a`. This means `r` can reference `x` because Rust knows that the reference in `r` will always be valid while `x` is valid.

Now that you know where the lifetimes of references are and how Rust analyzes lifetimes to ensure references will always be valid, let's explore generic lifetimes of parameters and return values in the context of functions.

### Generic Lifetimes in Functions

We'll write a function that returns the longer of two string slices. This function will take two string slices and return a single string slice. After we've implemeted the `longest` function, the code in Listing 10-29 should print `The longest string is abcd`.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("abcd");
    let string2 = "xyz";

    let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2);
    println!("The longest string is {}", result);
}
```

Listing 10-20: A `main` function that calls the `longest` function to find the longer of two string slices

Note that we want the function to take string slices, which are references, rather than strings, because we don'_t want the `longest` function to take ownership of its parameters. Refer to the "String Slices as Parameters" section in Chapter 4 for more discussion about why the parameters we use in Listing 10-20 are the ones we waant.

If we try to implement the `longest` function as shown in Listing 10-21, it won'_t compile.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

Listing 10-21: An implementation of the `longest function that returns the longer of two string slices but does not yet compile

Instead, we get the following error that talks about lifetimes:

```rust
$ cargo run
   Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects.chapter10)

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0106`.
error: could not compile  `chapter10` due to previous error
```

The help text reveals that the return type needs a generic lifetime parameter on it because Rust can'_t tell whether the reference being returned refers to `x` or `y`. Actually, we don'_t know either, because the `if` block in the body of this function returns a reference to `x` and the `else` block returns a reference to `y`!

When we're defining this function, we don'_t know the concrete values that will be passed into this function, so we don'_t know whether the `if` case or the `else` casee will execute. We also don'_t know the concrete lifetimes of the references that will be passed in, so we can'_t look at the scopes as we did in Listing 10-18 and 10-19 to determine whether the reference we return will always be valid. The borrow checker can'_t determine this either, because it doesn'_t know how the lifetimes of `x` and y` relate to the lifetime of the return value. To fix this error, we'll add generic lifetime parameters that define the relationship betwee the references so the borrow checker can perform its analysis.

### Lifetime Annotation Syntax

Lifetime anootations don'_t change how long any of the references live. Rather, they describe the relationship of the lifetimes of multiple references to each other without affecting the lifetimes. Just as functions can accept any type when the signature specifies a generic type parameter, functions can accept references with any lifetime by specifying a generic lifetime parameter.

Lifetime annotations have a slightly unusual syntax: the names of lifetime parameters must start with an apostrophe (`'`) and are usually all lowercase and very short, like generic types. Most people use the name `'a` for the first lifetime annotation. We place lifetime parameter annotations after the `&` of aa reference, using a space to separate the annotation from the reference's type.

Here are some examples: a reference to an `i32` without a lifetime parameter, a reference to an `i32` that has a lifetime parameter named `'a`, and a mutable reference to an `i32` that also has the lifetime `'a`.

```rust
&i32            // a reference
&'a i32         // a reference with an explicit lifetime
&'a mut i32     // a mutable reference with an explicit lifetime
```

One lifetime annotation by itself doesn'_t have much meaning, because the annotations are meant to tell Rust how generic lifetime parameters of multiple references relate to each other. For example, let's say we have a function with the parameter `first` that is a reference to an `i32` with lifetime `'a`. The function also has another parameter named `second` that is another reference to an `i32` that also has the lifetime `'a`. The lifetime annotations indicate that the references `first` and `second` must both live as long as that generic lifetime.

### Lifetime Annotations in Function Signatures

Now let's examine lifetime annotations in the context of the `longest` function. As with generic type parameters, we need to declare generic lifetime parameters inside braces between the function name and the parameter list. We want the signature to express the following constraint: the returned reference will be valid as long as both the parameters are valid. This is the relationship between lifetimes of the parameters and the return value. We'll name the lifetime `'a` and then add it to each reference, as shown in Listing 10-22.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

Listing 10-22: The `longest` function definition specifying that all the references in the signature must have the same lifetime `'a`

This code should compile and produce the result we want when we use it with the `main` function in Listing 10-20.

The function signature now tells Rust that for some lifetime `'a`, the function takes two parameters, both of which are string slices that live at least as long as lifetime `'a`. The function signature also tells Rust that the string slice returned from the function will live at least as long as lifetime `'a`. In practice, it means that the lifetime of the reference returned by the `longest` function is the same as the smaller of theh lifetimes of the references passed in. These relationships are what we want Rust to use when analyzing this code.

Remember, when we specify the lifetime parameters in this function signature, we're not chaging the lifetimes of any values passed in or returned. Rather, we're specifying that the borrow checker should reject any values that don'_t adhere to theses constraints. Note that the `longest` function doesn'_t need to know exactly how long `x` and `y` will live, only that some scope can be substituted for `'a` that will satisfy this signature.

When annotating lifetimes in functions, the annotations go in the function signature, not in the function body. The lifetime annotations become part of the contract of the function, much like the types in the signature. Having function signatures contain the lifetime contract means the analysis the Rust compiler does can be simpler. If there's a problem with the way a function is annotated or the way it is called, the compiler errors can point to the part of our code and the constraints more precisely. If, instead, the Rust compiler made more inferences about what we intended the relationships of the lifetimes to be, the compiler might only be able to point to the use of our code many steps away from the cause of the problem.

When we pass concrete references to `longest`, the concrete lifetime that is substituted for `'a` is the part of the scope of `x` that overlaps with the scope of `y`. In other words, the generic lifetime `'a` will bet the concrete lifetime that is equal to the smaller of the lifetimes of `x` and `y`. Because we've annotated the returned reference with the same lifetime parameter `'a`, the returned reference will also be valid for the length of the smaller of the lifetimes of `x` and `y`.

Let's look at how the lifetime annotations restruct the `longest` function by passing in references that have different concrete lifetimes. Listing 10-23 is a straightforward example.

```rust
fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("long string is long");
    
    {
        let string2 = String::from("xyz");
        let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
        println!("The longest string is {}", result);
    }
}
```

Listing 10-23: Using the `longest` function with references to `String` values that have different concrete lifetimes

In this example, `string1` is valid until the end of the outer scope, `string2` is valid until the end of the inner scope, and `result` references something that is valid until the end of the inner scope. Run this code, and you'll see that the borrow checker approves; it will compile and print `The longest string is long string is long`.

Next, let's try an example that shows that the lifetime of the referennce in `result` must be the smaller lifetime of the two arguments. We'll move the declaration of the `result` variable outside the inner scope but leave the assignment of the value to the `result` variable inside the scope with `string2`. Then we'll move the `println!` that uses `result` to outside the inner scope, after the inner scope has ended. The code in Listing 10-24 will not compile.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn main() {
    let string1 = String::from("long string is long");
    let result;
    {
        let string2 = String::from("xyz");
        result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2.as_str());
    }
    println!("The longest string isi {}", result);
}
```

Listing 10-24: Attempting to use `result` after `string2` has gone out of scope

When we try to compile this code, we get this error:

```rust
$ cargo run

  |

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0597`.
error: could not compile `chapter10` due to previous error
```

The error shows that for `result` to be valid for the `println!` statement, `string2` would need to be valid until the end of the outer scope. Rust knows this because we annotated the lifetimes of the function parameters and return values using the same lifetime parameter `'a`.

As humans, we can look at this code and see that `string1` is longer than `string2` and therefore `result` will contain a reference to `string1`. Because `string1` has not gone out of scope yet, a reference to `string1` will still be valid for the `println!` statement. However, the compiler can'_t see that the reference is valid in this case. We've told Rust that the lifetime of the reference returned by the `longest` function is the same as the smaller of the lifetimes of the references passed in. Therefore, the borrow checker disallows the code in Listing 10-24 as possibly having an invalid reference.

Try designing more experiments that vary the values and lieftimes of the references passed in to the `longest` function and how the returned reference is used. Make hypotheses about whether or not your experiments will pass the borrow checker before you compile; then check to see if you're right!

### Thinking in Terms of Lifetimes

The way in which you need to specify lifetime parameters depends on what your function is doing. For example, if we changed the implementation of the `longest` function to always return the first parameter rather than the longest string slice, we wouldn'_t need to specify a lifetime on the `y` parameter. The following code will compile:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &str) -> &'a str {
    x
}
```

We've specified a lifetime parameter `'a` for the parameter `x` and the return type, but not for the parameter `y`, because the lifetime of `y` does not have any relationship with the lifetime of `x` or the return value.

When returning a reference from a function, the lifetime parameter for the return type needs to match the lifetime parameter for one of the parameters. If the reference returned does *not* refer to one of the parameters, it must refer to a value created within this function. However, this would be a dangling reference because the value will go out of scope at the end of the function. Consider thsi attempted implementation of the `longest` function that won'_t compile:

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
fn longest<'a>(x: &str, y: &str) -> &'a str {
    let result = String::from("really long string");
    result.as_str()
}
```

Here, even though we've specified a lifetime parameter `'a` for the return type, this implementation will fail to compile because the return value lifetime is not related to the lifetime of the parameter at all. Here is the error message we get:

```rust
$ cargo run
   Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects/chapter10)
error[E0515]: cannot return reference to local variable `result`
 --> src/main.rs:11:5
   |
11 |    result.as_str()
   |    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ returns a reference to data owned by the current
                        function

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0515`.
error: could not compile `chapter10` due to previous error
```

The problem is that `result` goes out of scope and gets cleaned up at the end of the `longest` function. We're also trying to return a reference to `result` from the function. There is no way we can specify lifetime parameters that would change the dangling reference, and Rust won'_t let us create a dangling reference. In this case, the best fix would be to return an owned data type rather than a reference so the calling function is then responsible for cleaning up the value.

Ultimately, lifetime syntax is about connecting the lifetime of various parameters and return values of functions. Once they're connected, Rust has enough information to allow memory-safe operations and disallow operations that would create dangling pointers or otherwise violate memory safety.

### Lifetime Annotations in Struct Definitions

So far, the structs we've define all hold owned types. We can define structs to hold references, but in that case we would need to add a lifetime annotation on every reference in the struct's definition. Listing 10-25 has a struct named `ImportantExcerpt` that holds a string slice.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
struct ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    part: &'a str,
}

fn main() {
    let novel = String::from("Call me Ishmael. Some years ago...");
    let first_sentence = novel.split('.').next().expect("Could not find a '.'");
    let i = ImportantExcerpt {
        part: first_sentence,
    }
}
```

Listing 10-25: A struct that holds a reference, so its definition needs a lifetime annotation

Thsi struct has one field, `part`, that holds a string slice, which is a reference. As with generic data types, we declare the name of the generic lifetime parameter inside braces after the name of the struct so we can use the lifetime parameter in the body of the struct definition. This annotation means an instance of `ImportantExerpt` can'_t outlive the reference it holds in its `part` field.

The `main` function here creates an instance of the `ImportExcerpt` struct that holds a reference to the first sentence of the `String` owned by the variable `novel`. The data in `novel` exists before the `ImportantExerpt` instance is created. In addition, `novel` doesn'_t go out of scope until after the `ImportExcerpt` instance is created. In addition, `novel` doesn'_t go out of scope until after the `ImportantExcerpt` goes out of scope, so the reference in the `ImportantExerpt` instance is valid.

### Lifetime Elisions

You've learned that every reference has a lifetime and that you need to specify lifetime parameters for functions or structs that use rerferences. However, in Chapter 4 we had a function in Listing 4-9, shown again in Listing 10-26, that compiled without lifetime annotations.

Filename: src/lib/rs

```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..i];
        }
    }

    &s[..]
}
```

Listing 10-26: A function we defined in Listing 4-9 that compiled without lifetime annotations, even though the parameter and return type are references

The reason this function compiles without lifetime annotations is historical: in early versions (pre-1.0) of Rust, this code wound'_t have compiled because every reference needed an explicit lifetime. At that time, the function signature would have been written like this:

```rust
fn first_word<'a>(s: &'s str) -> &'a str {}
```

After writing a lot of Rust code, the Rust team found that Rust programmers were entering the same lifetime annotations over and over in particular situations. Theses situations were predictable and followed a few deterministic patterns. The developers programmed these patterns into the compiler's code so the borrow checker could infer the lifetimes in these situations and wouldn'_t need explicit annotations.

This piece of Rust history is relavent because it's possible that more deterministic pattens will emerge and be added to the compiler. In the future, even fewer lifetime annotations might be required.

The patterns programmed into Rust's analysis of references are called the *lifetime elision rules*. These aren'_t rules for programmers to follow; they're a set of particular cases that the compiler will consider, and if your code fits these cases, you don'_t need to write the lifetimes explicitly.

The elision rules don'_t provide full inference. If Rust deterministically applies the rules but there is still ambiguity as to what lifetimes the references have, the compiler won'_t guess what the lifetime of the remaining referencese should be. Instead of guessing, the compiler will give you an error that you can resolve by adding the lifetime annotations.

Lifetimes on a function or method parameters are called *input lifetimes*, and lifetimes on return values are called *output lifetimes*.

The compiler uses three rules to figure out the lifetimes of the references when there aren'_t explicit annotations. The first rule applies to input lifetimes, and the second and third rules apply to output lifetimes. If the compiler gets to the end of the three rules and there are still references for which it can'_t  figure out lifetimes, the compiler will stop with an error These rules apply to `fn` definitions as well as `impl` blocks.

The first rule is that the compiler assigns a lifetime parameter to each parameter that's a reference. In other words, a function with one parameter gets one lifetime parameter: `fn foo<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'a i32);` and so one.

The second rule is that, if there is exactly one input lifetime parameter, that lifetime is assigned to all output lifetime parameters: `fn foo<'a>(x: &'a i32) -> &'a i32`.

The third rule is that, if there are multiple input lifetime parameters, but one of them is a `&self` or `&mut self` because this is a method, the lifetime of `self` is assigned to all output lifetime parameters. This third rule makes methods much nicer to read and write because fewer symbols are necessary.

Let's pretend we're the compiler. We'll apply these rules to figure out the lifetimes of the references in the signature of the `first_word` function in Listing 10-26. The signature starts without any lifetimes assocaited with the references:

```rust
fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {}
```

Then the compier applies the frist rule, which specifies that each parameter gets its own lifetime. We'll call it `'a` as usual, so now the signature is this:

```rust
fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &str {}
```

The second rule applies because there is exactly one input lifetime. the second rule specifies that the lifetime of the one input parameter gets assigned to the output lifetime, so the signatire is now this:

```rust
fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {}
```

Now all the references in this function signature have lifetimes, and the compiler can continue its analysis without needing the programmer to annotate the lifetimes in this function signature.

Let's look at another example, this time using the `longest` function that had noo lifetime parameters when we started working with it in Listing 10-21:

```rust
fn longest(x: &str, &str) -> &str {}
```

Lets apply the first rule: each parameter gets its own lifetime. This time we have two parameters insteadd of one, so we have two lifetimes:

```rust
fn longest<'a, 'b>(x: &'a str, y: &'b str) -> &str {}
```

You can see that the second rule doesn'_t apply because there is more than one input lifetime. The third rule doesn'_t apply either, because `longest` is a function rather than a method, so none of the parameters are `self`. After working through all three rules, we stull haven'_t figured out what the return type's lifetime is. This is why we got an error trying to compile the code in Listing 10-21: the compiler worked through the lifetime elision rules but still cound'_t figure out all the lifetimes of the references in the signature.

Because the thirdd rule really only applies in method signatures, we'll look at lifetimes in that context next to see why the third rule means we don'_t gave to annotate lifetimes in method signatures very often.

### Lifetime Annotations in Mehtod Definitions

When we implement methods on a struct with lifetimes, we use the same syntax as that of generic type parameters shown in Listing 10-11. Where we declare and use the lifetime parameters depends on whether they're related to the struct fields or the method parameters and return values.

Lifetime names for struct fields always need to be declared after the `impl` keyword and then used after the strct's name, because those lifetimes are part of the struct's type.

In method signatures inside the `impl` block, references might be tied to the lifetime of references in the struct's fields, or they might be independent. In addition, the lifetime elision rules often make it so that lifetime annotations aren'_t necessary in method signatures. Let's look at some examples using the struct named `ImportantExcerpt` that we defined in Listing 10-25.

First, we'll use a method named `level` whose only parameter is a reference to `self` and whose return value is an `i32`, which is not a reference to anything:

```rust
impl<'a> ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    fn level(self: &Self) -> i32 {
        3
    }
}
```

The lifetime parameter declaration after `impl` and its use after the type name are required, but we're not required to annotate the lifetime of the reference to `self` because of the first elision rule.

Here is an example where the third lifetime elision rule applies:

```rust
impl<'a> ImportantExcerpt<'a> {
    fn annouce_and_return_part(self: &Self, announcement: &str) -> &str {
        println!("Attention please: {}", announcement);
        self.part
    }
}
```

There are two input lifetimes, so Rust applies the first lifetime elision rule and gives both `&self` and `announcement` their own lifetimes. Then, because one of the parameters is `&self`, the return type gets the lifetime of `&self`, and all lifetimes have been accounted for.

### The static Lifetime

One special lifetime we need to discuss is `'static`, which denotes that the affected reference *can* live for the entire duration of the program. All string literals have the `'static` lifetime, which we can annotate as follows:

```rust
let s: &'static str = "I have a static lifetime."; 
```

The text of this string is stored directly in the program's binary, which is always available. Therefore, the lifetime of all string literals is `'static`.

You might see suggestions to use the `'static` lifetime in error messages. But before specifying `'static` as the lifetime for a reference, think about whether the refereence you have actually lives the entire lifetime of your program or not, and whether you want it to. Most of the time, an error message suggesting the `'static` lifetime results from attempting to create a dangling reference or a mismatch of the available lifetimes. In such cases, the solution is fixing those problems, not specifying the `'static` lifetime.

### Generic Type Parameters, Trait Bounds, and Lifetimes Together

Let's briefly look at the syntax of specifying generic type parameters, trait bounds, and lifetimes all in one function!

```rust
fn longest_with_an_announcement<'a, T>(
    x: &'a str,
    y: &'a str,
    ann: T,
) -> &'a str
where
    T: Display,
{
    println!("Announcement! {}", ann);
    if x.len() > y.len() {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

This is the `longest` function from Listing 10-22 that returns the longer of two string slices. But now it has an extra parameter named `ann` of the generic type `T`, which can be filled in by any type that implements the `Display` trait as specified by the `where` clause. This extra parameter will be printed using `{}`, which is why the `Display` trait bound is necessary. Because lifetimes are a type of generic, the declarations of the lifetime parameter `'a` and the generic type parameter `T` go in the same list inside the braces after the function name.

### Summary

We covered a lot in this chapter! Now that you know about generic type parameters, traits and trait bounds, and generic lifetime parameters, you're ready to write code without repetition that works in many different situations. Generic type parameters let you apply the code to different types. Trait and trait bounds ensure that even though the types are generic, they'll have the behavior the code needs. You learned how to use lifetime annotations to ensure that this flexible code won'_t have any dangling references. And all of this analysis happens at compile time, which doesn'_t affect runtime performance!

Believe it or not, there is much more to learn on the topics we discussed in this chapterr: Chapter 17 discusses trait objects, which are another way to use traits. There are also more complex scenarios involving lifetime annotations that you will only need in very advanced scenarios; for those, you can make sure your code is working the way it should.
